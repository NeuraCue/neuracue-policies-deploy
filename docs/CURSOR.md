## Claud Code Context Philosophy

- Addresses context engineering challenges through hierarchical, persistent, and dynamic context
  management system that implements 4 core context engineering principles.
    - Write Context: persistent memory systems
        - long-term memories (across agent sessions)
        - scratchpad (within agent session)
        - state (within agent session)
    - Select Context: intelligent context retrieval and injection
        - retrieve relevant tools
        - retrieve from scratchpad
        - retrieve long-term memory
        - retrieve relevant knowledge
    - Compress Context: efficient context representation and summarization
        - summarize context to retain relevant tokens
        - trim context to remove irrelevant tokens
    - Isolate Context: multi-agent and scoped context management
        - partition context in state
        - hold in environment/sandbox
        - partition across multi-agent
